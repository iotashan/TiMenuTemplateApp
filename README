# TiMenuTemplateApp

This is a starting point for new apps that need a navigation drawer.

## Getting Started

Install the global dependencies & highly useful tools:

```
brew install imagemagick
npm i -g tishadow ticalabash gittio ticons
```

Install the local dependencies:

```
cd path-to-this-project
npm install
```

Enter the password you normally enter for `sudo` when requested.
Use sudo before npm install if you get an `Error: EACCES` message.

Don't forget to generate a new GUID for your tiapp.xml file!
